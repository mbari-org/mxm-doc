## MXM documentation source

The main branch of this repository contains the source of the MXM documentation.

The documentation source is written in plain text files using
[Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) syntax.

[MkDocs tool](http://www.mkdocs.org/) is used for the site generation.
The documentation site is deployed at <https://docs.mbari.org/mxm/>.

The [webhook](https://github.com/adnanh/webhook) tool is used to automatically
update the documentation site upon pushes to the main branch.

More details about the doc generation mechanism
